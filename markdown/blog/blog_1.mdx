# The Story Behind Sopu's Biryani

Chef Sopu's passion for biryani began in his grandmother's kitchen. Over decades, he perfected the slow-dum method and a spice blend that brings out deep, layered aromas without overpowering the rice.

- Hand-roasted masalas for a fresher aroma
- Balanced marination for tender meat
- Dum-cooking to lock flavours

Our recipes focus on technique and quality ingredients. Whether Hyderabadi, Lucknowi, or our house special, each plate reflects a commitment to tradition and flavour.
