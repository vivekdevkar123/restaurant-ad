# Sopu's Kitchen — Sopu's Biryani House

This repository contains the Sopu's Kitchen website — a rebranded, single-chef biryani-focused site built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Run the development server

```
npm run dev
```

This project was adapted from a public template and rebranded for Sopu's Biryani House; external demo and distribution links have been removed from this README and the site.
